    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="png.png" alt="Picture of me">
    <p>My name is Noah, and I was born in Cheyenne, where I also grew up. Living there shaped a lot of who I am today and gave me the opportunity to discover my interest in technology at a young age.
         Over time, I became increasingly curious about how computers, software, and systems work, which pushed me to start learning more on my own.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading manwhas, coding, working, and catching up on sleep whenever I get the chance. Reading manwhas helps me relax and unwind, while coding allows me to challenge myself 
and improve my problem-solving skills. Working keeps me responsible and motivated, and getting enough rest helps me stay focused and productive in my daily life. Together, these activities help me maintain a balance between relaxation and personal growth.</p>

<p>Looking toward the future, I hope to pursue a career in the field of information technology. I want to continue expanding my knowledge of technology, gain hands-on experience through practice and 
real-world situations, and build a strong foundation of technical skills. My ultimate goal is to secure an IT job where I can grow professionally, contribute to meaningful projects, and apply what I have learned to solve realworld problems while continuing to learn and improve over time.</p>
