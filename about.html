    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="png.png" alt="Picture of me">
    <p>My name is Noah, and I was born in Cheyenne, where I grew up and started developing an interest in technology. I enjoy spending my free time reading manwhas, coding, working, and catching up on sleep whenever I can. These hobbies help me relax while also allowing me to build useful skills and stay productive.

In the future, I hope to pursue a career in IT. My goal is to continue learning more about technology, gain hands-on experience, and eventually secure an IT job where I can grow professionally and apply my skills to real-world problems.</p>
